# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

### COURSE METHODOLGY
Thousands of resources and hundreds of practice sites are always just a google search away, to learn and practice Data Structures and Algorithms, but still a lot of students struggle in learning and practicing it perfectly üî•, 
But Why So ? üòß 

  - Lack of proper guidance & mentors üò¨ 
  - Confusion about "WHERE TO STUDY FROM & HOW TO PRACTICE?" üòï 
  - Lack of community learners üë¨ 
  - Most importantly, ABSENCE OF ROADMAP (infact CODEMAP) ‚ùì :
  

# How Girl Code It is solving this problem?
  - Its senseless & sheer waste of time to create new video lessons or lectures of topics which already is available on Internet, The problem is a beginner/learner doesn't know the best resource to pick.
  - This is what we do at GCI, Our expereinced mentors with their leanring and working expereince pick the best resource and practice assignments and make a roadmap for the students which they can easily follow.
 

 Well, Yes it's that simple, 
 
 
 ### HOW THE COURSES WORK?
- We will email you milestones one by one. These milestones have learning and practice resources.
- Once you complete a milestone, you have to send the screenshots of the projects or whatsoever related to the current milestone to your mentor.
- Only after you do the current milestone and send its proof, you will be mailed the next milestone.
- Progress Tracking Sheet - Student's regularly update their progress which is monitored by mentors. 

### DOUBT CLASSES
- Ask all your doubts or any concerns on the communication channel (DONT PERSONALLY MESSAGE YOUR MENTORS)
- If you need a personal doubt class, let us know, we will arrange a zoom call doubt session for you.


### RULES
There are just 2 Rules
- If you miss a deadline, you will be warned once. 
- If you miss 3 deadlines consecutively, you will be expelled from the course. (VERY STRICT FOR THIS)
